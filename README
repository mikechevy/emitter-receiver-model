This README file will be updated with more intructions. This README file will describe how to process the experimental imaging data and reproduce the experimental results presented in the paper.  The image processing code is contained in the file process_imaging_data_MATLAB_Paper.zip.  Also,    This readme file will describe how to use the multicellular model to reproduce the modeling results presented in the paper.  The modeling code is contained in the file .
